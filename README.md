# Overview
This is a proof of concept for a platforming action-adventure type game I have titled Crete. The idea is that you play as someone who will find themselves in the caves of the isle of Crete in Greece, and must find your way to the center of Daedalus' maze, in order to defeat the minotaur and go home. The game is played with the W, A, S, and D keys as primary movement, with a sliding feature by pressing control, and a grappling hook by clicking the left mouse button. The mouse also serves as the movement for the camera.

This is a proof of concept for a full game that I would like to make at some point with custom models, environment, music, and full voice acting.

# Development Environment
To make this game, I have used the Unity Engine, and VSCode.

The game itself is built on the C# language.

# Future Work
* Make custom textures for the terrain, enemies, and movement system (Grappling hook and character model).
* Program actual enemy AI, to be an actual threat to the player.
* Create custom music and write full story (this includes gameplay elements such as upgrades, environmental hazards, and events that occur throughout the game).
